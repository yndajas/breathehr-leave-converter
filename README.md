# Breathe leave calculator: hours and minutes to days

[Breathe][breathe] is a HR tool. It can be used to track annual leave
allowances. When you work part-time or compressed hours, you might see your
leave allowance in hours and minutes rather than days. This is for accuracy, but
it's hard to read as a human.

This adds a approximate conversion from hours and minutes to days. This sits
below the hours and minutes figure. You can enter your daily hours in a text
box and the day calculation will update. By default, it's set to 7h45m per day.
